# Intro

I'll try recap what we did and what I think can be the next step. I will use a "frozen" version of the dataset, this way it will be possible to understand any difference in future analysis.

```{r loadDataAndPackages }

#the frozen dataset

isotopes=read.csv("data/DATA isotopie_Pryce_V13092022.csv")



```


The first level of reflection we had on Monday afternoon was: how to automatically asses the "consistency" of two sample ; _ie_ how can we confidently say there isotopic composition is the same




# Consistency check

KWPV=do.call("rbind",disratio[c("NKH","NPW")])
allratio= apply(KWPV,2,function(v){ y=1-sapply(v,function(i)i/max(v)); y[y!=0]; })
